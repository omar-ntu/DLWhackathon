# DLWhackathon
source code for Deep Learning Week hackathon for group name whoosh_goren

our problem statement is personalising the standardised education in schools.

Currently, schools have about 1 teacher to 30 students, which makes teaching less efficient as the standardised education cannot cater to each student's needs.
We have created this programme with a simple AI that helps to overcome this issue. This programme basically acts like a practice book. 
It poses the student questions for them to practise on. The algorithm detects which topics they are weak in, and will pose more questions in those topics.
When the student has improved, the programme will give harder questions.

Thank you for reading. This is my first ever README so I hope I'm doing it right. It was a huge challenge doing this hackathon since all of our group members
have little to no prior knowledge on programming or AI.
